# Starmath v2

Starmath is an educational math game. 

# Motivation
This game was born from an academic project, where the goal was only to build a game with any programming language. So, Starmath is an idea to make the child train with numbers and make calculations faster.

# Team
  
  
# Technical resume
It was built initially only with cordova in a academic project. So, in this repo, the code was refactored and reestructured with Ionic 3.

So, the main goal (talking about code) in this repository are:
  * Create an structure around the game, ranking, tutorial, etc.
  * Better code.
  * Universal code (In first project, the code was writed in portuguese, here, it will be translated to english).
  * Update code from es5 to es7/es8.
  * Increase user experience in game, of course.
